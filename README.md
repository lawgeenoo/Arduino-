# Arduino
Messing around with an Arduino Uno clone. Small projects made at home. Since the video was too large for Github, you can view it at the link listed below:

-basically, emulating parking sensors.

An ultrasonic sensor(HC-SR04) hooked to an UNO clone, fitted to a toy car. I have used the HC-SR04 library to simplify things. Used a simple buzzer for beeping. The device is rigged to make different beeping patters at roughly 20, 10 cm away, respectively continuous beep at 5 cm or less from the obstacle.
